# Fruit-Ninja
For my term project I created an implementation of Fruit Ninja. You click and drag your mouse to slice the fruit being thrown up. In original mode your goal is to not miss any fruit, and avoid bombs to get a high score. In zen mode the goal is to slice as many fruit as possible in 60 seconds, with no penalty for missing the fruit. There are also ice cubes in original mode, that when sliced slow down the fruit, allowing you to increase your score with no bombs and no penalty for missing any fruit.

How to Run: Run normally, the only other files in the folder are for sounds, images, and a text file to keep track of your high score.

Libraries: No additional libraries need to be installed.
